# Arcade Game Project--Bug Invasion

Welcome to my arcade game! This game was designed as part of Udacity's Front-End Web Developer Nanodegree. Enjoy!

## Objective

The bugs have invaded!  Escape the bug invasion by making it to the water without colliding into the bugs! 

## How to Play

* At the start of the game, your player will have 500 points.
* Move your player up, down, right and left to avoid the bugs. 
* If you collide with a bug, you loose 100 points.
* If you make it to the water without colliding with a bug, you earn 100 points.

## How to Win

* If you player earns 1,000 points, you win!
